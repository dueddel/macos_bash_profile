# Extension for `ls`

&larr; [back to snippet collection](./../../README.md)

## Description

This snippet extends the `ls` command by pretending you manually added the options `-lhF` for printing a long list, appending a slash "/" to all directories and for printing human readable filesizes (KB, MB etc. instead of just the number of bytes).

## Requirements

 - none

##  Usage

Nothing special to say here. Just invoke the `ls` command as you're used to it.

```bash
# use `ls` command as usual
ls
# also no difference when adding other options and arguments
# e.g. for listing all files (including hidden files)
ls -a
```
