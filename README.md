## 🕳 Lack of features?

This collection is by far not exhaustive since its contents are just my **personal preferences**.

🤩

So, there's a chance that a few or all of the given scripts and terminal tweaks are not exactly what you searched and came here for.  
You also might miss many scripts you actually need or you have other cool ideas which I never even thought of. In either case just cry or **adapt the collection to your needs**.
