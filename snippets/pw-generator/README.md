# Password generator command

&larr; [back to snippet collection](./../../README.md)

## Description

This snippet adds a new command for generating strong passwords (32 characters long and of course cryptic).

## Requirements

 - ensure `pwgen` is installed (on MacOS you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

##  Usage

It's as easy as typing `pw` into your terminal.

```bash
# two letters only to generate a new password, here we go:
pw
# that's it!
# the password will now be printed to the terminal
# and also it will be copied to your system clipboard
# now, try pasting the content from your clipboard…
yeiL3aif:aete9raiX7ricai,m^iegee
# … but do not hit [Enter], this is just for testing ;)
```

Fun fact:  
When the freshly generated password is printed to the terminal it actually comes directly from your system's clipboard.
