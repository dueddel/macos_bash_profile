# Extension for `history`

&larr; [back to snippet collection](./../../README.md)

## Description

This snippet increases the maximum length of entries in the bash history to 10,000. For MacOSX this seems to be limited to 500 by default. Furthermore this snippet adds a timestamp to all entries.

## Requirements

 - none

##  Usage

Nothing special to say here. Just invoke the `history` command as you always do.

```bash
# use `history` command as usual
history
# also no difference in combination with pipe and regex
history | grep ssh
```
